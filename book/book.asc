Structure

== Introduction
Too thin to be good, Rework, Lean

== What makes SaaS different?
  * the no-cost-model makes it a total psychology game
  * The insignificance of costs of upselling

== Basic Principles of Pricing psychology
 * the beauty and the tiers
 * Three or five, instead of fifteen
 * obvious and clear differentiation
 * the principle of the steps, example of adolf film

=== How low can you go?
 - the cheapest trier is what you'll be able to market with, so make it cheap

=== Enterprise ain't part of this
if the company is big enough having someone who's job it is to buy this stuff, then they'll call you and ask to negotiate custom pricing and if its just to justify their job. So charge them for it, sell them custom service and adk for 10x your normal price. Those are numbers they want to talk about. 
  - be open but don't offer one-click solutions, it wont be used anyways

== Upselling without Upsetting
=== How apple designed their upselling process and why it is genius:
   - Second page
   - default off 
   - big space to convince about the upgrade
   - move price out of scope
   - focus on the cheap, individual upgrade
   - ignore other upgrades/there is no reason to have them comparable

=== what to upsell with
  - know your numbers
  - example of shoutcast in sf

== the golden grail: pay as you go
 - paying for flexibilty
 - AWS example of an amazing case (most expensive and must successful hosting in history)
 - Why and how it works
 - Applying those principles to the three steps and making even more money:
   - included tiers/reserved instances
 - Charging for their success, in-app-upgrading

== Other pricing still makes sense:
  - look at market (example of arab lawyers) and value chain there
  - Luxury and high-class products
  - saving compared to the asistant argument
