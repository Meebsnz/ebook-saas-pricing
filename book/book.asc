== Introduction
This book is thin. If you believe a book can only be good when it is gigantic, this is not for you. Thanks for reading this book, but you can stop now. If on the other hand, you like that I am telling you, this book is thin, that it only contains the stuff that should and need to be said and nothing more, then this book is for you. 

As such, this book won't tell you what Software-as-a-Service is — you should know that already. It won't tell you how to structure, design or build this nor the business around it. It won't tell you anything about markets or people in these. Because you like your time not to be wasted with too many words, unrelated stories and anecdotes. You just want the no-bullshit cut-to-the-chase information.

Welcome to the book, that's gonna teach you all you need and want to know about SaaS-App-Pricing. This book is going to explain to you how to determine the right price and pricing schema for your Software-as-a-Service (Web-)Application. And though many of the rules might also apply to things like Kickstarter Campaigns, this book focuses on reoccurring subscription pricing of SaaS for consumer and B2B-business.

If you are here to just get a number, let me tell you it is €29.95 per month (respective $39.95). This book is going to tell you why and which cases it is different. But if you don't care and just want a number, odds are, this is the number you want.

== What makes SaaS different?
Software as a Service business is a very interesting model. As it is in most of the case a subscription based system, you are not forced to sell to new customers but can focus on building a great product for your existing customers.

Another highly fascinating thing about SaaS Apps is, that they are essentially no costs. Of course, you need people to build it, make it better and scale it, but that is cheap in comparison to what costs you have in other businesses, where you need to buy expensive special vehicles, materials or tools. As the term says it, you are in the service business and a highly and cost-efficient scaling one, too.

And as software is your service, sure you have a certain set of features but every software is unique at the end of the day and you can't (and most people won't) compare the list of features from one App to the other. Most likely you have a feature no other competitor offers while they have features, you don't need or want to have. Which makes your customers, your customers and you always want to convince them with a different argument than "being cheaper" – your competitors, too, by the way.

Running a software in this business means, you are not bound to competitive pricing or have any numbers running the business for you. Setting the price for a software as a service offer is a total psychology game. But one of high importance as it is a key factor whether people can and want to buy (or effort) it. The beauty of it though, once you've find your target, it's gonna sell like hot cakes. And on top, you have basically no costs with upselling either. We'll come back to that a little later.

== Basic Principles of Pricing psychology

Software as a service product have a few spins to it, a few I've just mentioned before. Another one that comes with it, it the ability to repackage it into any kind of size for basically no extra costs. You can sell the same thing just in three or four different sizes. Thus allowing you to have an offer for each budget size.

And there we've already found one key instrument: have multiple tiers. To give the options and let the customer think about what they want. But be careful to give only a few. Giving too many options because a lot to read, compare and in the end too hard to decide – a fundamental problem with crowd funding pricing. These tiers should be viewable in one page, their differences and benefits clearly distinguishable. I have the best experiences with setting three pricing levels - some argue it's five, but I often feel that is too much to read (as you need five clear differentiations).

As said, pricing an SaaS is mostly psychology and the counter part is the customer.   

=== How low can you go?
The lowest of the tiers is the one, you can use for advertising and marketing. Try to make it as low as you can think without having the feeling of selling out to cheap. This is also the (only) tier you offer the free trial on. By making it rather cheap, this has the nice additional benefit that even if people the decide to not stick with you, if the number is low, they are less likely to cancel it (as it feels it's not worth the effort). So, if you can reasonably offer your service for €9.99/month, do that.

=== Too thin
Because it is too thin anyways. The offer of that lowest pricing shouldn't be bad or cheesy, but don't forget it is your marketing-offer to get people to look into your service. Offer a service,which is "just not quiet enough". You should have an idea about, who your customer is, done some personas and research, so you know what they need. Maybe they'll run through ten clients a month, then eight are included in your tier, they are running a radio stream with music so they need 192kb/s mp3, include up to 128kb, if they have revenue of 15k per month, your tier allows up to 10k – you get the picture.

The more obvious it is this tier isn't quiet enough for them, the better, don't let scream into their face, but use terms and numbers they understand. The reason you want to do that is the following: they are checking your pricing. Which means, they are interested in your service and most likely want to use it. If they just want to try it, those numbers don't mean much and they'll hit the "free trial button" without looking into it for too long. But if they really consider, then you've already sold it, you just need to settle on the price now. By making the cheapest unusable to them, they immediately move to the second tier.

=== The second is good, the third is to settle
Now this tier offers much more than the first one we've talked about. Not only can they run their business with it but it is almost too generous, offers much more than they ever feel to be needing. For just about double the initial price (or slightly less) - very good. And that is the price range they want to and _should settle_. But by offering so much already, all they ever wanted, they become curious about what more you could be offering. And they look at the third and compare it to the second.

Now here it becomes interesting. By increasing the price slightly but adding something extra-ordinary - even if they don't necessarily need it - they become very interested. Because there is so much more in there in comparison to what is in tier 2 but it isn't that much more expensive. So in comparison it even feels like a really good offer, you get more for your money. In my experience this is done the best by adding exactly one key thing on top. Like for the audio-stream example, add a second stream - it adds a lot but got "thrown in" rather cheap.

.The psychology behind this
NOTE: has been explained very well by link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOhb4LwAaJk[Dan Ariely in this youtube video]: we don't know our preferences that well and therefore are receptive to influences like supposedly good offers in comparison to another.

=== Real world case
I did exactly this pricing range for a crowd funding campaign for a Hollywood movie and though it never finished (because of internal problems), we had it in the phase of money raising. I told them to put up the following tiers:

 * 9.95 € - you were thanked on the website, got access to the bonus material and live updates through the websites about the shoot, as well as a download-link for movie as soon as it gets released on Bluray

 * 29.95 € - Same as before, but you'd also be mentioned in the credits of the movie.

 * 49.95 € - Aside from the news updates, being mentioned in the credits, you'd also be receiving a real disc version of the Bluray.

This allowed the studio to advertise with "support this movie starting from 9.95€". But the real deal was, getting mentioned in the movie, so people were immediately checking the second higher tier as the first didn't offer this. And though many settled on this, for less than double the price, you'd also receive a Bluray - well, doesn't that sound great?

So, thought 57% of the people (another 21% went for the first and 22% for the second). We sold them a Bluray disc for 20€. A movie - not a DVD-set. A movie they already have access through a download link to. A Bluray discs, which costs essentially nothing in product (why they wanted to offer it as part of the lowest pricing range initially). We wouldn't have gotten anyone to pay for this, if I had said it this way. But through this pricing schema, we could. And they were happy to do so.

.This is a kickstarter like campaign
[NOTE]
====
Given, this is not a reoccurring subscription but a fan-driven one-time transaction also selling the fact, that you are taking part in getting something done that without you wouldn't happen, so people are generally more generous.

But using a similar pricing scheme with 19.90€, 29.90€ and 39.90€ would probably have the same effect on a subscription basis.
====

=== Ending with the Nine
I've very bluntly ignored the discussing of the pricing numbers and given you cases that all end with the number 9. If you are at least a little familiar with the subject, you should be very aware that we don't exactly know why, but having the price end with a nine outsells every other option (with 5 and 7 right behind but off by far). This has been shown in a series of studies, like link:http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1023581927405[this one from MIT] and discussed in detail in books like link:http://www.amazon.com/dp/080909469X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp["Priceless" by William Poundstone] footnote:[Published at Hill and Wang, 2011, ISBN 978-0809094691] so I won't get into detail on this again.

=== Enterprise ain't part of this
This all only applies, if your customers are mainly end-consumers and small- and mid-size companies but not for enterprise. The basic rule goes like this: if the company is big enough to have someone, who's job is it to mainly buy this kinda stuff, they'll call you up and ask to negotiate a custom pricing tier with you. And even if that is only to justify the existence of their job (as they have work to do: negotiate with you), they'll do it.

But as this costs extra effort on your side in comparison to auto-serviced customers, don't forget to charge them for it, too. Aside from your three tiers, you add another box on the bottom saying you are open to discuss further models and individual pricing for bigger customers or special areas (like non-profits or education, like Google is doing). And that negotiation you go from 2 simultaneous stream to 10 and add a big support package on top, that you sell for at least ten times the highest price you have on your tiers. That at least puts it back into the price-range that enterprise is used to and happy talk about: they really rather buy the service for 5k€ than for 50€ as the later is harder to justify.

That is also why even your highest priced tier should have some limits you can sell to enterprise and high-class customers - otherwise you'd nothing to sell them. And even if they eventually settle for eight times the highest tier so they feel they negotiated stuff out of you, it was worth the effort for you. But don't ever think that this is an option to include via one-click sign-up. Enterprise won't do one-click-sign-up of it anyways.

== Upselling without Upsetting
I talked about the beauty of upselling within SaaS-Product before a little. The greatest thing is, what you upsell often doesn't cost you any more anyway. And though a good pricing strategy on the overview page we've discussed before, can already get the people into getting the more expensive tier, there is more you can upsell with. Sadly, upselling has been abused in the past, like airlines tricking you into getting a "travel insurance" by already checking the field for you. To some it has a bad taste to it and why not, that behavior is pretty upsetting to anyone. Which is really not the first experience you want to make starting to do business with them. Understand that the upsell is still part of the first experience chain and getting this right is important.

One company that gets upselling very right is Apple. Like everything in this chain, this also is a question of the communication and ways to present it to the other party, which decides whether it works or not. And though Apple sells end-consumer hardware, the same principles still apply to the upsell of SaaS product during the initial checkout. Let's see how they do it.

=== Case Study: Upselling like Apple
When you go to the Apple online store to buy a new MacBook Air (as an example), you are presented with different models, similar to our packages or tiers from before:

.Selecting a Macbook Air
image::image/page-1-above-fold.png[A Screenshot of the Macbook Air Selection]


Same as we discussed for our tiers, there are just a few things different in these tiers, that make for a big distinction: the first being the Screen size (either 11 inch or 13) and the secondary being the flash storage. By presenting those very blunt, Apple makes the question which one to buy not about the price but first about the screen size — which they do very clever by having the second screen even be presented bigger — and in the secondary stage about the storage. First you pick the screen size, then the storage and then you are presented with the price. The price in this way is merely a result of our decisions and wasn't part of the decision in the first place. 

And now that you've decided what you want, you don't really care that Apple is selling you 128GB of storage for 200EUR extra anymore. But it gets even better once you are selecting this one. Because then Apple presents you with the "configuration page", a second page to actually upsell you even more.

.The "configuration" page
image::image/apple-store-page-2.png[The configuration screen]

Sure, you can actually configure the CPU, memory and keyboard in here (which you probably want to do actually) but there is plenty of things listed, which are actually about selling you more things: how is an external screen, an AppleTV or a Printer part of a MacBook Air configuration? Well, it isn't.

But by having this second "configuration"-screen, Apple does something very smart here. It took the decision of which general package you picked out of the scope. That has already been decided, the other options aren't presented anymore. And by splitting this into two pages, you don't have to bother about comparing prices of the configuration to other packages anymore. Adding 8GB of RAM on a 13-inch could potentially cost more than on the 11-inch (which could even have plausible, technical reasons), but no costumer would actually go back and check. Because picking another basic package isn't of any question anymore.

Another thing you've hopefully noticed is the way this is presented: Apple takes four-fifth of the width to focus on the configuration. The summary of what you've selected on the other hand is just a tiny part on the right. And though it is showing the total price, always stays with the user and as such gives them total transparency about their choices, by keeping it to the top right, we are less likely to look at it or at least not until we've scrolled down the main part totally already.

By also splitting them into big chunks that basically cover the bigger part of your screen while you scroll over them, each upgrade becomes separate from the others, making them appear as individual, not too expensive choices. And I have to actively decide on each one, that I don't want them though it is only 29,99€. And by keeping them separate, the decision I just made for the thunderbolt cable has nothing to do with the mini-display-port-cable I am looking at right now. Look it's only 29,99€. In the customers brain the other decision has been done and labeled as such, so just because I want the mini-display-port, the customer would probably not go back and change his mind on items before in the list.

.Default is "None"
[NOTE]
====
One major flaw that many (airlines) do, is preselecting upsell-options and forcing the user to actively remove the selection in an often complicated way. Tricking a customer into upselling is an obvious way to have more people upsell but makes the customer angry and educates the user you aren't a trustworthy party.

Unlike how Apple is doing it here, making it clear you don't get tricked into buying anything you don't want by communicating: "It is your choice. We are happy either way. We just think this might be of interest to you, too." And the customer listens. And they buy. And they are happy about it.
====

==== The upsell
Let's take a look at the individual things Apple tries to sell here. The same as on a normal product page, it needs to be selling the user, so it looks good, is interesting and gets quite some space. By giving upselling so much room, Apple has enough space to present the product and all important information and list the options. Just scrolling over them is going to take a little and at least one is going to catch your eye.

And once again, how they present it, is of high importance. Let's take this external storage as an example:

.Upselling you the Thunderbold storage
image::image/page-2-storage-none.png[Thunderbold Storage]

Not only does it have quite some room and scrolling over it takes long enough for our eye to catch and the brain to notice the content, but also the way of decision making is again like before. By presenting the price in square brackets it appears to be merely a consequence of the decision but not really part of it. No, the details of option to select are in foreground. And it gets better, because Apple isn't done upselling once you selected one option:

.After selecting an option, the price disappears
image::image/page-2-storage-selected.png[Selected a Storage]

Did you notice the difference? Apple changed the prices. As I have decided on an Option, not only does it become part of my decision (and the summary) so the price disappears, also the other prices are updated to only show the difference in pricing. Genius. Not only because now the more expensive options don't appear to be as expensive any more but also because by phrasing it "Subtract 349,95€", even the "None" option now appears to be costing something triggered by providing a positive number. Our brain immediately notices that as high, and it takes a while before it processed that "subtract" needs we have to negate it. 

And though thinking of the negative is something our brain generally can't do, by using words here this also requires other parts of the brain to process it. It would be quite different if instead of "subtract", it would show the minus sign or – even worse – color-code the values red and green, things our brain would understand immediately. But this subtle way of saying it, the brain needs to process much more information and in different parts and given the size of those numbers aren't that big, we don't think it is very important to do that. Making it more likely to stick with the selection or even chose another one that feels less expensive now. Again, Apple changed the conversation and moved it behind the question whether you take this or not and towards whether you want to take more instead.

=== What to upsell
In order to be able to upsell, you need to know your numbers. You should know them inside out anyway but especially those things, people think they need or want and which are slightly outside the scope of the main product, are of interest here. The examples mentioned before still apply here, so for example buying an upgrade to stream 256kb/s instead of just up to 192kb/s on a radio stream. Or even offering 320kb/s as the ultimate upgrade, so that DJs are super happy to be able to offer the best quality though the actual effect for most listeners wouldn't actually change after 192kb/s anyway.

Upsell is always the question of what you need, want and might want to need. Like in the Apple example, selling video adapters and printers just makes a lot of sense. Because I am buying the laptop with specific needs in mind. And by showing me those options I am reminded that I actually want to show presentations at conferences with it so I need an adapter. 

Another example that comes from the radio service I was mentioning before, is about one specific feature, which actually costs them nothing and was a default for long time but is something very easy and cheap to upsell with: stream to shoutcast service. Shoutcast is an external server that would then handle the distribution of the streams meaning that only one stream out is needed at any time as the distribution would be handed off to a third party. Enabling this feature would be classic thing to upsell with. Not only because more people think they need it than actually ever will use it but also as the numbers show plenty people actually do use it instead of taking the more expensive tier with more streams.

By having to buy this feature extra on the second page, people are very likely to be willing to pay a higher total than just getting a tier that costs more but includes more streams and would cover them. People pay for control and convenience.

<<<<

== The golden Grail: Pay As You Go
The latest addition to the pricing models in the SaaS market is the pay-as-you-go-model. One of the first to offer this and make tons of money with it was Amazon with its Web Services (AWS). In there you'd be paying for only what you use as in CPU-Cycles, storage and traffic. Unlike many other services which only give you limited resources and block them for you, this model allows you to easily grow your business starting very small but becoming very big, too. Out of convenience many didn't switch at later points, making Amazon the a very expensive but one of the most widely used infrastructure cloud solutions out there. Leaving analysts puzzled how they do it.

Though it is obvious because in a pay-as-you-go model the selling point actually isn't the resource itself. What you sell people are flexibility and convenience. Flexibility because most of those services offer a very, very low starting tier a basic offer that is free in most cases. You can spin up a free instance on AWS within half an hour and try out thing you want to build. For many things, this is enough to get started and once the project gains some traction and generates traffic, the customers are fine to upgrade to bigger machines and pay for resources.

And in a pay-as-you-go-model you barely have any tiers to take, no steps to grow. The payment grows with the customers of the customer. And though those are priced very high, as they are always directly linked to the amount of customers they have, it is very easy to calculate that into the price. At the same time it is highly flexible and promises to be able to handle peaks for you, too. Peaks are good for your business as that means more business as well but if you run out of your traffic package that is very bad. The pay-as-you-go-model might be more expensive than the same resource somewhere else but you are paying not for the actual resource but for the flexibility to use resource you don't need at the moment.

The other thing it sells is the promise of growth. This is a service that makes it easy for you to grow. It is even in their interest for you to grow. And that is the best model you can ever have, the one that has an interest in their customers base to have more business. Greatest of all business goals.

=== Applied to tiers
Now thinking back of the tiers we talked about before, how does that integrate in a pay-as-you-go-model? Amazon has been pioneering here as well, with a feature they call "reserved instance hours". It boils down to a classic and old principle: the discount if you buy a lot and pay upfront.

Basically instead of being charged for every minute you use, you say at the beginning of the period that you'll pay for at least 2 full CPU months and Amazon gives you that for a discount. If you actually don't use them, you pay too much but if you do, you don't pay as much as for the normal pay-as-you-go. If you need more resources than that, you often pay a discounted price on those resources, too. Not as good as the offer for the reserved resource but still cheaper than if you hadn't reserved at all. 

So, if there is any way that you can create billable resources through your service, this is the model you want to go for. Going back to the radio streaming example from before: one stream hour could be such a resource – Every hour that one persons listens to a stream. Now on the lowest tier, you'd have to pay nothing, get 1.000 StreamHours included but every stream hour after is at 10cent - this would account for a little more than one full-time-listener but is enough to try the service and see if it works for you. As you'd have upgrade the shoutcast-streaming feature anyway this isn't a long-term option for you. But 10cents per stream per person per hour also doesn't sound too much to pay.

The second tier now costs, let's say 39€, includes 5.000 StreamingHours and every hour on top costs another 8cents. And the next one includes 15.000 at 79€ at 6cents the more hour and the one for 99€ contains 50.000 StreamingHours with any hour after being as cheap as 2cents. This is only a calculation example and doesn't necessarily work in the real world but it illustrates the idea. Because the concept of tiers still works here, with the special feature that you can even offer a tier of 0€ you make money with. Might even make more money with the other tiers.

The reason why you still want the other tiers here, is obvious. Aside from that it makes business predictions easier, you can also reward your customers on their success. Instead of making it the experience of "well, you had so many streams, we had to cut your services", you can make it the story of "Congratulations on your peak of listeners last week. We just wanted to let you know, for successful Radio Streams like yours our Tier B has a pricing system, with which you've saved 100€ this month alone already.". You become part of their success story, a supporter and helper on the way. Not the technology that failed on them during the best stream of their lifetime.

You are suddenly also much more interested in the numbers of each and every client and love to serve them to optimize those, give them insights and dashboards, even live stats to make them do their job better. And once you understood this mechanic behind the curtains, it becomes obvious why Amazon is so successful. It isn't because of their resources, it is because of the business model implemented in through their pricing scheme.

== Other pricing still makes sense
That all said, I think there is good reason to price your SaaS-Service around the given tiers. But that doesn't mean you have to or should be doing this. As these pricings work and are most likely working for the majority of SaaS-Projects out there, there are still a few markets, where a different pricing (in terms of the actual numbers) makes much more sense.

=== Enterprise
I mentioned enterprise before: if the majority of your customers will be in that segment and you'd actually have to sell via the phone, the pricing categories don't make much sense because customer acquisition is not going through the Internet and self-signup and be way more expensive. Also, as said before, they like to talk about bigger numbers generally. Calling a head of sales to sell them a subscription of 50€/month just sounds like a waste of time to them.

=== High-priced customers
Another classic case I encountered at an incubator I mentored in Palestine, where one startup wanted to build a case-management-SaaS-Software for Arab Lawyers and wanted to price it at around 30$. I argued that Lawyers are a high-pricing audience, they don't buy suites because the price is low but because the price is high. They are used get paid a lot but also to pay a lot,their whole value-chain is high-priced from their suits, over the consultants they hire up to the parties they throw. The predominantly mentality in their line of business is that a product sold at that price can't be of high value. They'd rather be bragging how expensive something was than how cheap it was.

So in such a case I'd look at my target group and look for "what they'd be saving" and arrange my pricing around that. In this example, if the software is done properly, this would save the lawyer their office assistant - which would probably be costing them at around 600$ in the market we are talking about. So if you can offer the same service for 399$, argue that they'll still be saving a lot of money, it comes of as comparably cheap (compared to the office assistant) but still have them value the product a lot.

This is a very classic selling but also price-setting argument actually: finding a real world costs it would replace and put your tier lower than that but providing a similar service. This also directly puts you in pricing competition against something, which price most likely rather stable and won't undermine the costs of the technology very soon.

Other markets with a similar attitude would be doctors, recruiters, head-hunters and HR. And I am sure there are others, so look at your market and the customers closely. 

[NOTE]
====
Also, in this case the argument was rather simple for that price because at 30$ even if they got 10% of all Arab lawyers to sign up, they wouldn't get enough revenue to pay their own employees. So don't forget to also take that into account, when talking about the price you can offer.
====

=== Luxury and Brand
Another classic case of when you should avoid the how-low-can-you-go-rule is in luxury products and brand-associated services. It is a known phenomenon that if you decrease pricing for luxury products, you make less money. There always need to be the luxury gap between the ordinary champagne were the pricing ends around 70€ per bottle and the one luxury segment that starts at 600€. But making pricing your bottle at 500€, you are to expensive for the normal market but too cheap for the luxury segment. Luxury people buy because the price is intentionally too high.

A similar effect goes for brand-associated products and services - unless of course the brand focuses on being cheap generally. Normally brands try to create an emotional connection and become part of who you are. That also puts it in a certain pricing segment, that the customer defines itself in. By going under that segment, you might reach new customers, but you won't convince your usual segment. And that'd disrupt your market share in ways, you don't want to cope with. A good example for this would be offering a Cloud-Solution by Apple: the apple customer defines themselves as someone, who cares more about User experience and Design than money. But offering a market competitive pricing or even something cheaper, you risk of creating the feeling of doing something cheap. And you want to avoid that by all means.

== Closing notes
This is written towards the end of 2013. All pricing in this book should be adapted to inflation and future shifts in spending willingness. And though I have been writing this online and it is intended for future updates, please take this into account when you look at the numbers. 

That said, I'd love to have your input and stories about this, too. This is only my shared experience but if you have something to share or say about this, please don't hesitate to email me at ben@create-build-execute.com and maybe I will incorporate this into the next update. Thank you for reading.
